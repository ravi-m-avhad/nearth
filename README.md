**Inspiration**

We've heard about forest fires, storms, droughts, and other extreme weather occurrences that have been attributed to climate change. Regrettably for us, we never studied the effects of climate change on the ocean, **which covers more than 70% of our world**. It's all too easy to remain unconscious of this developing problem until it manifests itself as a problem for us. While learning in school can be tough and it can be difficult to recall critical information such as ocean acidification, temperatures and CO2 levels are at record highs. Ecosystems are deteriorating due to the melting of glaciers. The urgency of protecting our planet and achieving **Goal 14 of the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals **, which calls for conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development, is becoming increasingly evident. Mitigating ocean acidification is a critical step in accomplishing this goal, and it all begins with public education. Ocean acidification is occasionally referred to as "climate change's equally evil twin," and with reason: it is a significant and damaging consequence of excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that we do not see or feel because its effects occur underwater. At least a quarter of the carbon dioxide (CO2) released by coal, oil, and gas combustion is dissolved in the ocean rather than entering the atmosphere. **Since the dawn of the industrial age, the ocean has absorbed around 525 billion tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere, at a current rate of approximately 22 million tonnes per day**.

**What does Nearth mean?**
Having seen the kind of problem at our hands, are there any solution on which the world is focus at his moment?

**Planting hope: Seagrass**
Seagrass is a wonder-plant that lives in shallow, sheltered areas along our coast. It is vital to the health of our seas and can help address environmental problems. Seagrass captures carbon up to 35 times faster than tropical rainforests and, even though it only covers 0.2% of the seafloor, it absorbs 10% of the oceanâ€™s carbon each year, making it an incredible tool in the fight against climate change.

But our planting hope needs as well. 

**WHAT'S HAPPENING TO SEAGRASS?**

In the UK itself, up to 92 per cent of our seagrass has disappeared in the last century. WWF(World Wide Fund) working with Sky Ocean Rescue and Swansea University to bring these incredible underwater meadows back to life, by launching the biggest seagrass restoration project ever undertaken in the UK. This initiative needs to gain momentum and decentralized solution built on top of 5ire blockchain which will act as binding bond between many countries as blockchain transactions will ensure the data,transaction,security and performance at their highest quality. We facilitate accepting donation from lot of mindful people who want to help the cause but find it difficult to trust people and organizations. Cryptocurrency based donations and transactions transparency will inject the trusts amongst the environment enthusiast
With limited funds and limited resource tacking this problem can be really tricky. We are bringing best of technologies for best their best to empower the movement to reenergize planet earth. ** Powered with 5ire Blockchain **, Web 3, Cryptocurrency our solution builds solution with strong base of these cutting edge technologies. There are many organizations working to collect donations to restore the depleting layers of Seagrass. We will try to analyze how can be make best use of technology to collaborate, upscale and automate these initiatives to lend helping to this noble cause and rejuvenise our home planet.

This movement needs to across the global and will need sincere collaboration and trust between authorised of all involved countries. This directly implies that 5ire blockchain powered decentralized app is the need of the hour. Local communities will benefit from the solution by establishing a virtuous loop of value exchange between three parties: a qualified donor, a decentralized Platform, and a sponsor.

**Glossary :**
* Potential Donor - anyone who could possibly donate SGF to a local Platform 
* Qualified SGF(Seagrass Fund) Donation - A SGF donation to the Platform 
* Nearth - Platform that accepts donations in the form of SGF 
* SGF Token - A donation token (NFT) given to a eligible donor after a qualified SGF donation 
* SGF donor - a registered SGF donor deemed eligible to donate by a participating Platform 
* Sponsor - A participating local business or community organization that agreed to return some predetermined value to a SGF donor in exchange for a SGF token. 
* Value - economic or community value that sponsors communicate to SGF donors in order to incentivize the redemption of SGF Tokens.

**Flow of Donors**

1) Create an account on Nearth Using Nearth platform, a potential SGF donor can find a Platform in their area based on their location. The user will be able to see on a map where the centers are located and also if they have a high demand for SGF. Once the user sees that there is a demand for their type of SGF in close proximity, they can review the contracts, sign the contract to register for an account, and visit the Platform location.

2) Donate and Receive a SGF Token Once the potential SGF donor register on platform, they will need to complete the eligibility criteria for the specific donation. The Platform will also be able to post pre-requisites on their profile page so the potential donor can decide if they meet the criteria before visiting. If the potential donor is deemed eligible by the Platform, they can proceed with the SGF donation and are referred to as eligible SGF donor. Once completed, the Platform can certify the completion by minting a SGF token valid in their specific community. The donor will receive the SGF token from the Platform to the QR code displayed through the application. Once a SGF token is received in a donor's account, the SGF token becomes redeemable with a sponsor.

3) Redeeming a SGF token with a sponsor An eligible SGF donor can redeem their SGF token with a sponsor. The user can log into the Nearth app to find the sponsor's general information, opening hours, and what they offer in exchange for a SGF token. Once they decide on a sponsor where they would like to redeem the SGF token, they can go to the physical location or visit their website if the business is an e-commerce enabled business. At checkout, the eligible donor will be prompted to transfer the SGF token to the sponsor to redeem the offer. Once the transfer is complete, the sponsor provides the offer to the donor, and the SGF token transfers to the sponsor's account. Once a donation token receipt is received into a sponsor account, the SGF token is only transferable to other Nearth accounts.

**Sponsor User Flow**

1) Register as a Sponsor A local business or organization can register to become a sponsor on the Nearth application. The user will be prompted from a landing page to review and accept the terms of participation. Once accepted, the user will be able to create a profile to enter general information, location, hours of operation, products, services and offer a value proposition in exchange for a SGF token.

2) Accessing the dashboard Once a participating business has completed the registration process, they will be able to access the Nearth dashboard. The dashboard will show the balance of SGF token received over time, their current value proposition offer and a toggle to redeem SGF tokens. If a eligible SGF donor wishes to redeem a SGF token, the sponsor would access the redeem option on the dashboard.

3) Accepting a SGF Token A registered sponsor can accept SGF tokens from any eligible SGF donor that wishes to buy goods or services as defined in the terms of participation. When a eligible SGF donor makes a qualifying purchase as displayed on the sponsor's Nearth profile, the eligible donor can redeem a SGF token in exchange for the value proposition as specified by the sponsor. To redeem a SGF token, the sponsor must show their sponsor account QR code as displayed on the application to the eligible SGF donor wishing the make a purchase. The donor will scan the QR code and transfer the SGF token from their account to the sponsor account. Once received in the sponsor account, the community donation token receipt is considered redeemed and is non-transferable. If the SGF token has an expiry date, the transfer from the eligible donor to the participating business will mark the end of the term. The end of the term must come before the expiry date.
